# Custom Network Protocol Parser

A C programming project that demonstrates embedded systems and Arduino-style network communication concepts without requiring physical hardware.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project simulates the packet-based communication protocols commonly used in Arduino and embedded systems networking. It showcases fundamental skills in:

- **Low-level C Programming**: Direct memory management, structs, and pointers
- **Network Protocol Design**: Custom packet structure with error detection
- **Embedded Systems Concepts**: Error checking, data validation, and communication protocols
- **Arduino-style Architecture**: Function organization and communication patterns

## üöÄ Why This Project?

Based on analysis of embedded systems and networking career requirements, this project bridges the gap between Arduino framework programming and professional embedded development by:

1. **Demonstrating Protocol Implementation**: Shows understanding of how devices communicate over networks
2. **Teaching Memory Management**: Uses C's manual memory handling like embedded systems require  
3. **Simulating Hardware Constraints**: Implements packet size limits and error checking typical of resource-constrained devices
4. **Building Portfolio Skills**: Creates code that recruiters recognize as relevant to network programming and embedded engineering roles

## üîß Technical Features

### Packet Structure
```c
typedef struct {
    uint8_t start_marker;     // Packet boundary detection
    uint8_t packet_id;        // Unique identifier
    uint8_t command;          // Action to perform
    uint8_t data_length;      // Payload size
    uint8_t data[16];         // Actual data
    uint8_t checksum;         // Error detection
    uint8_t end_marker;       // Packet boundary detection
} NetworkPacket;
```

### Key Capabilities
- **Error Detection**: XOR checksum validation
- **Protocol Validation**: Start/end marker verification  
- **Command Processing**: Simulated Arduino commands (LED control, sensor reading)
- **Data Integrity**: Buffer overflow protection and bounds checking
